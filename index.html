          <h2>Reaching Out the World</h2>
          <p>House of Prayer For All Nations is a missions Church.
            From it's inception, Bishop Emily has been working hard 
            to build a church that will raise great men and women of God, 
            who would go into the City, the Country, the World to raise 
            more great men and women. Bishop Emily has desired to see a Church 
            that will Impact, in a very Practical and Real way, the Lives 
            of the Communities and People around us.
          </p>
          <p>The Vision of HoPFAN is to Win Souls and Make Disciples. We 
            understand that this involves us taking various approaches to reach
            into and have an Impact in our families, communities, as well as train
            and equip belivers to be able to raise up others.
          </p>
          <p>HoPFAN approaches <b>Missions</b> in two streams - <b>Home missions</b> - within
             Kitale and Kenya; and <b>International missions</b> - primarily targeting
            several African countries. </p>
            <h2>Home Missions</h2>
            <p>This has meant reaching the Trans Nzoia and it's environs foremost.
              The life of HoPFAN is found in it's cell group, where relationships
              are built and nurtured, believers encourage each other in the Walk of Faith.
              For this reason, the cell groups provides a unique platform to reach 
              to friends, neighbors, relatives, work-mates and acquitances.
            </p>
            <p>Home Missions also targets needs throught the country - including our 
              annual Serve Day, Prisons outreaches, Mercy ministries, Hospital outreaches
              Prayers walks, Evangelism events among many more. These are done within the 
              cell groups and corporately.
            </p>
            <p>In addition, HoPFAN aims to reach the nation through planting of local 
              congregations, as well as working with like-minded partner Churches around
            the Country. Beyond Kitale, we've had the privilege of planting HoPFAN

            <div class="give"></div>
          </div>

          <p>Our Generous giving - through tithes, offerings, mission 
            commitment among others mave made it posible for us to meet our
            needs of our growing church as well as doing everything God 
            has called us to do in impacting our communities, our Country 
            and Continent with the Love and Gospel of Jesus Christ.
          </p>
          <h2>Give</h2>
          <p>Financial giving in the Church is mainly in two categories
             - Tithes and Offerings. The Bible teaches us to honor God by 
             giving 10% of our income (that's Tithe). Anything we give 
             above that is an offering.</p>
             <p>At HoPFAN, we have two categories of Giving that are cause - 
               specific: <i>Mission Commitment</i> goes directly to our outreach
               endeavors. This Giving helps us to invest in our communities, 
               support missionaries, plant churches and so much more.
               Secondly, Our <i>Project Advance</i> Giving helps position the
               Church for upgrade needs as they arise.
             </p>
             <p>We believe that there is a Blessing that God gives to Us as we 
               invest in the affairs of His Kingdom and so we love to give at 
              House of Prayer For All Churches, Kenya, and have a deep Bible based 
            value for every opportunity we have to Give.</p>
            <p>Leviticus 27:30 "All the tithe of the land, whether of the seed of
              the land or the fruit of the trees, is the Lord's; it is holy to
              the Lord.
            </p>
            <p>Malachi 3:10 Bring the full tithes into the storehouse, that there 
              may be food in my house; and thereby put me to the test, says the Lord
              of hosts, if I will not open the windows of heaven for you and pour down
              for you an overflowing blessing.
            </p>
            <p>Here are options you could offer your Tithes and Offerings:</p>
